Optimizations to run less migrations on CI

Django migrations are slow because of state recreation for every migration and other internal Django magic.

In the past, I tried to optimize that, but discovered it's a [running issue](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29898).

## Assumptions

1. I want to run my migrations on CI. It is a sanity check, even if they are generated by Django in some cases.
1. I don't have to run migrations all the time. If migrations didn't change, I can reuse them.
1. The solutions probably are CI-specific and database-specific, but it is possible to write code for a generic workflow and snippets to support each CI.

## Idea

### Generate database state from migrations
GitLab CI (the one I have more experience, but I'm sure others have similar features) has caching based on versioned files.

I can cache database state, based on migrations files (and installed dependencies?).

When cache exists, load this database state (restore?) before your tests and run your tests without migrations.

When cache doesn't exist, run migrations and dump the final state for an SQL file.

Dump and restore are database-specific, but possible to handle all Django supported databases.
